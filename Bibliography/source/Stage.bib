  Abstract                 = {Mining of data streams must balance three evaluation dimensions: accuracy, time and memory. Excellent accuracy on data streams has been obtained with Naive Bayes Hoeffding Trees?Hoeffding Trees with naive Bayes models at the leaf nodes?albeit with increased runtime compared to standard Hoeffding Trees. In this paper, we show that runtime can be reduced by replacing naive Bayes with perceptron classifiers, while maintaining highly competitive accuracy. We also show that accuracy can be increased even further by combining majority vote, naive Bayes, and perceptrons. We evaluate four perceptron-based learning strategies and compare them against appropriate baselines: simple perceptrons, Perceptron Hoeffding Trees, hybrid Naive Bayes Perceptron Trees, and bagged versions thereof. We implement a perceptron that uses the sigmoid activation function instead of the threshold activation function and optimizes the squared error, with one perceptron per class value. We test our methods by perfor},

CONTRIBUTIONS : 
Les auteurs pr?sentent une m?thodologie pour analyser et explorer les donn?es Twitter en temps r?el en utilisant des m?thodes de "data stream mining".

METHODOLOGIE :
* Twitter poss?de des conventions comme la r?ponse ? un utilisateur en pr?c?dent le pseudo par @ ou d?finir des sujets de conversations par des #. Enfin, RT pr?cise que ce sujet n'a pas ?t? ?crit par la personne qui le diffuse mais que cette derni?re ? fait suivre le message.
* Twiiter c'est un milliard de tweets par semaine.

* Le framework propos? se focalise sur trois sujets : (1) Classer les tweets en temps r?el. (2) D?tecter les changements. (3) Montrer quels sont les changements dans les termes les plus utilis?s.

* Tweets en entr?e sont trait?s par un calcul TF-IDF.
* Utilisation de SPACE SAVING parce que ?a marche mieux que le reste. L'algo garde en m?moire k paires (item,count). Initialis? par les k premiers ?l?ments et leur occurences. A chaque nouvelle entr?e, si elle existe alors on incr?mente le compteur sinon on remplace avec l'?l?ment le moins fr?quent.

* Utilisation du framework MOA ( http://moa.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ ) pour cr?er leur framework MOA-TweetReader.

CONTRIBUTIONS : 
DIscussion sur les m?thodes d'?valuations sur l'apprentissage des analyses streams. 
=> Pouver que, pour des algos d'apprentissage coh?rentes et un nombre infini d'exemples

METHODOLOGIE :

Software :
* VFML toolkit (Hulten and Domingos, 2003) for mining high-speed time-changing data streams
* MOA systel (Bifet et al., 2010) for learning from massive data sets
* Rapid-miner (Mierswa et al., 2006) a data minig system with plug-in for stream processing

Malgr? le nombre croissant d'algo sur ce sujet, pas de solution d'?valuation, de m?triques et de types d'exp?riences. Les principales difficult?s sont :
* Nous avons un flux continu de donn?es au lieu d'un ?chantillon fixe d'iid exemples
* Les mod?les d'?volutions ?voluent en fonction du temps et ne sont donc pas statiques.
* Les donn?es sont g?n?r?s par une distributions non statiques ? la place d'un ?chantillon stationnaire.

Il est important de cr?er un design d'?valuation que tout le monde peut faire. DIETTERICH(1996) propose une approche lorsque les donn?es sont abondantes.
Dans cette ?tude, les auteurs se questionnent sur "La strat?gie "Sampling" est-elle viable dans le cas d'un stream" ?

II ) Learning from Data Streams

HULTEN et DOMINGOS (2001) d?terminent les propri?t?s d?sirables d'un syst?me d'apprentissage pour un mining continu efficace, de grand volume, ouvert :
* N?cessite un court temps par exemple.
* Taille de m?moire allou? maximale fix?e, ind?pendamment du nbre d'exemples.
* Construire un mod?le de d?cision utilisant un seul scan des donn?es d'entrainement.
* g?n?rer un mod?le ind?pendant de l'ordre des exemples.
* Abilit? ? traiter le concept drift.

Pour cela on fixe 3 dimensions :
* la taille en m?moire utilis?e
* Le temps d'apprentissage
* La capacit? ? d?tecter le vrai concept cach?

Cette ?tude est centr?e sur la 3e option. Mais les deux premiers ont une repercution directe sur le 3e.

La figure 1 montre qu'il existe un seuil o? il n'est pas utile d'ajouter des exemples pour augmenter la pr?cision

  Abstract                 = {This chapter presents a novel method for the detection and estimation of change in a data stream. To provide statistical guarantees on the reliability of detected changes, this method provides meaningful descriptions and quantification of these changes. Detecting changes in a data stream is an important area of research with many applications. The approach assumes that the points in the stream are independently generated, but otherwise makes no assumptions on the nature of the generating distribution. Thus, these techniques work for both continuous and discrete data. A meta-algorithm for change detection in streaming data is also described. The meta-algorithm reduces the problem from the streaming data scenario to the problem of comparing two sample sets. In order to compare the various statistics for nonparametric change detection, it is necessary to use simulated data, so that the changes in generating distributions are known.},

  Abstract                 = {Sentiment Analysis is defined as the computational study of opinions, sentiments and emotions expressed in text. Within this broad field, most of the work has been focused on either Sentiment Polarity classification, where a text is classified as having positive or negative sentiment, or Subjectivity classification, in which a text is classified as being subjective or objective. However, in this paper, we consider instead a real-world problem in which the attitude of the author is characterised by three different (but related) target variables: Subjectivity, Sentiment Polarity, Will to Influence, unlike the two previously stated problems, where there is only a single variable to be predicted. For that reason, the (uni-dimensional) common approaches used in this area yield to suboptimal solutions to this problem. Somewhat similar happens with multi-label learning techniques which cannot directly tackle this problem. In order to bridge this gap, we propose, for the first time, the use of the novel multi-dimensional classification paradigm in the Sentiment Analysis domain. This methodology is able to join the different target variables in the same classification task so as to take advantage of the potential statistical relations between them. In addition, and in order to take advantage of the huge amount of unlabelled information available nowadays in this context, we propose the extension of the multi-dimensional classification framework to the semi-supervised domain. Experimental results for this problem show that our semi-supervised multi-dimensional approach outperforms the most common Sentiment Analysis approaches, concluding that our approach is beneficial to improve the recognition rates for this problem, and in extension, could be considered to solve future Sentiment Analysis problems.},

This paper combines rule-based classification, supervised learning and machine learning into a new combined method. This method is tested on movie reviews, product reviews and MySpace comments. The results show that a hybrid classification can improve the classification effectiveness in terms of micro- and macro-averaged F 1 . F 1 is a measure that takes both the precision and recall of a classifier?s effectiveness into account. In addition, we propose a semi-automatic, complementary approach in which each classifier can contribute to other classifiers to achieve a good level of effectiveness. },

  Abstract                 = {Automated data acquisition systems, such as wireless sensor networks, surveillance systems, or any system that records data in operating logs, are becoming increasingly common, and provide opportunities for making decision on data in real or nearly real time. In these systems, data is generated continuously resulting in a stream of data, and predictive models need to be built and updated online with the incoming data. In addition, the predictive models need to be able to output predictions continuously, and without delays. Automated data acquisition systems are prone to occasional failures. As a result, missing values may often occur. Nevertheless, predictions need to be made continuously. Hence, predictive models need to have mechanisms for dealing with missing data in such a way that the loss in accuracy due to occasionally missing values would be minimal. In this paper, we theoretically analyze effects of missing values to the accuracy of linear predictive models. We derive the opt},
